        <h3> Goal of this work:</h3>
        <br> <p> 
            As a part of a college assignment, I worked in a group to refactor a bare bones 2D driving game. 
            I was responsible for refactoring the base game code into classes and objects. 
            A focus also being the implementation of the humble object pattern to make sure not too much responsibility is placed on one class alone. 
            Using the google test framework we also tested various aspects of the base code to ensure the behaviour of the game remained the same throughout the refactoring. 
            In addition to this I implemented a lap system, which gave the game an end goal while also continuously testing the features along the way to ensure any new ones didnâ€™t invalidate older ones.
